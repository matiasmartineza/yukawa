This is a Yukawa cartesian treecode, written in Python 
with bindings to C++, and interfaces to CUDA with PyCUDA.

Recursive relations for M2P were taken from:
Li, Johnston, Krasny. A Cartesian treecode for screened
coulomb interactions. JCP (2009).

To compile the C++ code type 'make all'

To run: type 'python treecode.py'

Dependencies:
    - Python
    - Numpy
    - PyCUDA
    - SWIG

if mode=='cpu' only CPU code is executed, 
if mode=='pycuda' CUDA code is used for the M2P and P2P.

Test case is a set of random particles in a 1x1x1 box.

This treecode is the base from where PyGBe - a treecode 
accelerated bondary element Poisson-Boltzmann solver - 
was developed. For details, see https://bitbucket.org/cdcooper/pygbe.

Code is a bit messy, but soon it will be cleaned

Enjoy!
